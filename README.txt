This is a small recreation by Ehren Collins of the 1991 game Lemmings by DMA Design.
The original game 114 levels with dozens more added over the years.  For the sake of time, this game
has only 12 though more may be added in the future.

Features and Controls
If the entire level cannot be seen at once, the w, a, s, and d keys can be used to move the camera

In addition to being able to click, each lemming job has a keyboard shortcut from 1 - 6:
    Walker - 1
    Digger - 2
    Tunneler - 3
    Floater - 4
    Blocker - 5
    Builder - 6
Some levels are dependent on quick and precise timings.  For such levels, the keyboard shortcuts are strongly
recommended.

Press escape to access the pause menu to reset the current level, use level codes to switch levels, or
return to the main menu.

In the event the game crashes or becomes unresponsive, Alt+F4 (the windows keyboard shortcut for end task)
will safely quit the program.
